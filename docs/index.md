# HaploGrep

HaploGrep provides a free mtDNA haplogroup classification webservice and command-line interface. HaploGrep reads sequences in FASTA format and returns haplogroup classification. Our approach uses a phylogenetic tree that uses the same nomenclature as Nextclade. For all processed datasets an extensive QC is performed.
