The phylogenetic tree, underlying "haplogrep", to be made in mtphyl format, so that it can be parsed and imported for usage in haplogrep. Thereby we need the haplogroup-,or clade- or lineage name as identifier in intended columns, followed by the mutations according the reference sequence MN908947.3
